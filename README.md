### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**ksenia-5/ksenia-5** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with computer vision.

Here are some ideas to get you started:


-->
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on natural language processing (NLP) for sentiment analysis.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning machine learning (ML) and completing the Aritificial Intelligence Bootcamp at Huddersfield University
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ML for inclusive interaction design.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about inclusive design, interaction design and creative coding.
- ðŸ“« You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kseniagermanovich/) and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ksenia5).
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I made an [interactive draw-your-own-jumper](https://vimeo.com/725794493) with creative coding, projection and wool.
