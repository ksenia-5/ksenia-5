### Hi 👋🏼

<!--
**ksenia-5/ksenia-5** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with computer vision.

Here are some ideas to get you started:


-->
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a team challenge on object detection in image data, while studying SQL, Python and JavaScript, all with Code First Girls.
- 🌱 I’m learning machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI).
- 🐜 I work as a [Maths and Science tutor](https://www.superprof.co.uk/encouraging-and-supportive-maths-and-science-tuition-london-from-experienced-passionate-and-dedicated-tutor.html) and design researcher. A current project uses webscraping and social media data mining for market research.
- 👀 I'm looking for an ML developer role.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ML for inclusive / interaction / communication / design for wellbeing and health.
- 💬 Ask me about inclusive design, interaction design and creative coding.
- 📫 You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kseniagermanovich/) and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ksenia5).
- ⚡ Fun fact: I made an [interactive jumper](https://colourstructure.cloud/pages/interact.html) with creative coding, projection and wool, and use code to make [art](https://colourstructure.cloud/pages/interact.html).
- 😃 Pronouns: She/Her
